            As an experienced director with over 10 years of managing and leading digital projects,
            I have supervised and mentored creative and technical teams while also being hands-on as
            needed on cross-platform executions for mobile, web, and social campaigns.

            In my current role, my primary responsibility is to support my team and ensure long-term
            goals are achieved with limited resources. My day-to-day consists of leading software
            architecture and optimization strategies, looking for bottlenecks in our work flow,
            coordinating with our creative and account teams, and prioritizing what gets done.

            envelope in a fast-paced deadline driven environment.
